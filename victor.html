            <h3>about-victor</h3>
                <p>Victor's firearm expertise reduces reloading time when wielding a submachine gun. He organically reduces SMG reloading time by 4% and this eventually becomes 5.5% when he reaches level 2.

                    The character has his own distinct voice, gestures that haven't appeared on PUBG mobile before. The commands given by his voice are also different from the existing ones. In addition to this, the character also has three 'Exclusive upgraded outfits': Scorching Armour, Alloy Armour and Legendary Conquest apart from the default clothing, as of now. While the Scorching Armour is mentioned to be unlockable on level 8, the other two outfits will unlock through Shards.
                    
                    His skills come to play in Evo Ground modes except the Team DeathMatch mode, that is, only in Infection Mode, Zombie: Survive Till Dawn and Zombie: Darkest Night modes. Victor, will however, appear as a character without his SMG reloading powers in the classic and arcade matches of the game.
                    
                    One can level up the characteristics of Victor by either using the EXP Card or by playing with him and earning coupons to the Victor Supply Crate. This Crate will be having Victorâ€™s outfits, masks, voice commands, emotes, Character Shards and their premium versions to draw from.</p>
