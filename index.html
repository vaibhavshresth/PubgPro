        <br>
        <p class="SubSectionTag text-small">Battlegrounds is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match. 
            <br>

        Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the four maps, with areas of approximately 8 × 8 kilometres (5.0 × 5.0 mi), 6 × 6 kilometres (3.7 × 3.7 mi), and 4 × 4 kilometres (2.5 × 2.5 mi) in size.[2] The plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.[1] Players start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay. Once they land, players can search buildings, ghost towns and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, and other equipment. These items are procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of a match, with certain high-risk zones typically having better equipment.[1] Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well.[1] Players can opt to play either from the first-person or third-person perspective, each having their own advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness; though server-specific settings can be used to force all players into one perspective to eliminate some advantages.[3] </p>

        <p class="SubSectionTag text-small">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.

        <br>
        <p class="SubSectionTag text-small">  Battlegrounds was first released for Microsoft Windows via Steam's early access beta program in March 2017, with a full release in December 2017. The game was also released by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One via its Xbox Game Preview program that same month, and officially released in September 2018. A free-to-play mobile version for Android and iOS was released in 2018, in addition to a port for the PlayStation 4. A version for the Stadia streaming platform was released in April 2020. Battlegrounds is one of the best-selling and most-played video games of all time. The game had sold over 70 million copies by 2020, with PUBG Mobile having been downloaded over 600 million times.
            
            Battlegrounds received positive reviews from critics, who found that while the game had some technical flaws, it presented new types of gameplay that could be easily approached by players of any skill level and was highly replayable. The game was attributed to popularizing the battle royale genre, with a number of unofficial Chinese clones also being produced following its success. The game also received several Game of the Year nominations, among other accolades. PUBG Corporation has run several small tournaments and introduced in-game tools to help with broadcasting the game to spectators, as they wish for it to become a popular esport. The game has also been banned in some countries for allegedly being harmful and addictive to younger players. </p>

                <h3>Arena training</h3>
                <p>Tencent Games has released a new game mode, called the Ranked Arena Mode. Players can access this new game mode from the EvoGround game mode selection tab. With the introduction of the new “Ranked Arena Mode, players don’t have to choose between pushing rank in Classic Mode or just playing a quick match through the TDM mode,” the company said in a release.

                    Players wanting to play the new Ranked Arena Mode will have to choose the type of match they want to play like Team Deathmatch, Assault and Domination. The game will then automatically choose the map at random.

                <p>PUBG Mobile has pushed out the new update for both Android and iOS platforms. The game now has a new Ancient Secret themed gameplay. The new mode can easily be selected from the menu while selecting the map and the mode for your gameplay. In this mode, the players will see an ancient secret building rising on Miramar and Erangel. The two-story structure begins each game at ground-level. Along with the progress of the game, the As the game progresses, the building begins to float and follows the play circle. <br>
                    In terms of the gameplay, the PUBG Mobile players need to fight against a secretive boss who will be waiting in a sealed room on the second floor of the building. So, basically, the players will need to go with the flow until they can reach the second floor. Once they do manage to defeat the boss, they will be rewarded.

                <h3>Infection Mode</h3>
                <p>n PUBG MOBILE’s Infection Mode, players are split into two teams at the beginning of the match, including Zombies and Defenders. Zombies must defeat all Defenders before the time limit ends the match for victory, but if even one Defender survives, the Defender team earns the Chicken Dinner. While Defenders boast firearms of M416 and AK47 with super Extended Mags, Zombies can only use melee attacks and abilities, which have cooldown times. Once defeated, Defenders will become infected and respawn as Zombies, who can even transform into Fast Zombie, Stealth Zombie, and the Zombie King with huge defense and attack boost. Defenders will also transform into powerful combatants called the Vanquisher when there are only three of them left. Infected killed by Vanquishers cannot be resurrected.

                <p>Keep in mind of course, that Rage Gear is divided into two modes in which the objective for each is different. In Rage Gear TDM, you are supposed to destroy as many vehicles as possible and reach the fixed limit before others. In the Pick Up mode, the focus is on collecting crates before the opponents do, but if you lose your vehicle any crates that you have collected will be lost. So apply your tactics accordingly based on the Rage Gear mode you're playing.

                <p>The Domination Mode is played in a new map called Town and there will be two teams -- Red and Blue with four players in each will be pitted against each. There are a total of three bases in the map and each team is expected to capture and hold a particular base for a time for long enough without getting killed. The team capturing two bases first wins. Domination mode also gets Super Weapon Crates to give an added boost in the game.
