            <h3> Description </h3>
            <p>Andy is a magician and puppet master. However, his career ended due to an ‘accident’. In order to get his revenge, Andy learned how to use guns and is now a master in gun-craft. If you're confused as to how the two are connected, believe me, you are not alone. 

                As with other characters, players can level up Andy by playing as him or by using character cards. </p>

            <h3>about-andy</h3>
                <p>Andy’s skills are only available in EvoGround mode and it is called Extreme Speed. As a magical and puppet master, Andy is quite deft with his hands and this directly affects his skills in which he is granted the ability to draw and put away his guns at a much faster rate. By default, he offers an 8% speed increase in drawing and putting away guns. At level 5, this speed is increased to 16%. <br>Andy’s skills make him a good choice for tactically sound players with a good knowledge of weapons and their limitations. Players who tend to stick to one weapon will not benefit from Andy’s skill. Rather, those players who regularly switch between their weapons depending on the situation stand to gain the most benefit. 

                    Another type of player that stands to gain most from Andy’s skill are players who end to engage in a lot of CQB (Close Quarters Battle) action. Andy’s skill will allow them to quickly switch weapons and continue on the offensive rather retreat and reload their weapon.</p>
