                <p class="para">While this scope appears mediocre in regard to its zoom power and reticle, the reticle allows the user an improvised method of rangefinding - a standing person 100 meters away will fit perfectly between the top and bottom of the outer circle, and a standing person 200 meters away will fit between the center dot and the outer circle. At 300 meters, the width of a standing person will be obscured by the center dot.</p>

                <p class="para"> The 3x scope represents a compromise between the 2x and 4x scopes. The reticle can be used as a rangefinder for targets between 100 meters out to 400 meters by using the shoulder width of a target and matching it up with the horizontal lines. The reticle brightness can also be adjusted to current lighting conditions.

                    Because the 3x scope's magnification sets the field of view to 26.66°,[1] players using a default field of view value higher than 80° will technically get slightly more than 3x magnification power due to the greater difference in FOV values.</p>

                <p class="para">The ACOG scope allows for the user to engage targets at medium to long ranges. With a built in rangefinder, and its 4x zoom, the ACOG scope is one of the most useful attachments a player can come across, as such it is highly recommended to take it, even if you do not have a weapon that can accept it.

                    As of the Miramar update, the 4x, along with Red Dot Sight and Holographic Sight, no longer have adjustable zeroing distance, setting the gun to a fixed 100 meter zero.

                <p class="para"> The 6x scope is a rare world spawn, being the highest powered scope for guns that don't fall into the category of DMR or sniper rifle. The reticle also features a stadiametric rangefinder suitable for standing targets between 300 to 800 meters. This scope is very versatile due to its simple rangefinder and ability to zoom out to 3x magnification, as well as its compatibility with assault rifles and submachine guns, greatly extending the range at which opponents can be attacked at.

                    Because the 6x scope's magnification sets the field of view to 13.33°,[1] players using a default field of view value higher than 80° will technically get slightly more than 6x magnification power due to the greater difference in FOV values.</p>

It is ideal for weapons with high muzzle velocities as compensation of gravity and bullet speed is not required as much compared to weapons with slower bullet velocities. Scope sway may be an issue at further ranges, therefore it is recommended to hold one's breath before firing.</p>

                <p class="para">An open holographic sight that projects a red dot in the center of a glass or acrylic pane. It also speeds up the time it takes to aim down the sights by 20%. Compared to the holographic sight, the red dot sight has a less bulkier frame, although the reticle is somewhat blurrier. Nevertheless, the red dot sight is a good addition to any gun that can accept it as it has no major downsides over iron sights. Featuring adjustable reticle brightness and shape when not attached to a pistol, the red dot sight can be altered to suit the user's needs on the fly.</p>
