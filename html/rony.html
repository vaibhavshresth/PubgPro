        The Rony is a vehicle in BATTLEGROUNDS. Exclusive to Sanhok, taking on the role of the UAZ and Pickup in BATTLEGROUNDS
        The Rony holds up to 4 passengers and excels at moving across Sanhok's hilly landscapes. Unlike the UAZ and Pickup, it is liable to rollovers when cornering at high speeds, therefore care must be taken as such. Anyone sitting in the rear cargo bed is completely exposed to incoming gunfire, therefore speed is the only protection. In terms of performance, the Rony is a middle ground between the UAZ and Pickup, with an acceleration time slower than the UAZ but faster than the Pickup, and handling characteristics closer to the UAZ.

        As with other vehicles, gas cans can be used while stationary to refuel, and a horn can be used to get the attention of teammates or anyone else within earshot of the horn. Cruising speed on a level surface tops out at around 101 km/h, however the engine can be boosted for a maximum speed of 110 km/h at the cost of increased fuel consumption. Like most other vehicles, the tires are vulnerable to gunfire and if destroyed, will reduce speed and handling performance.
