                <p class="para"> The Micro UZI is a submachine gun type weapon in BATTLEGROUNDS. A scaled down version of the original Israeli submachine gun designed by Major Uziel Gal in the early 1950s, first introduced in 1986 and exported to over 90 countries, it still sees active use in various conflicts around the world.[1][2][3] The Micro Uzi has had its stock removed, the magazine shortened, and the barrel reduced to almost pistol length. This results in a more compact, lightweight weapon, with a reduction in accuracy and range.</p>

                    The UMP, short for Universal Machine pistol, is a submachine gun designed by Heckler & Koch. The UMP is the successor to the MP5, though both are in service to this day. Widely adopted by police and governmental agencies, with wide adoption specifically amongst the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, it also sees popularity with players as an well-rounded, balanced SMG with manageable recoil and decent firepower.</p>

                <p class="para">The Vector is moderately accurate, and is quite possibly the most accurate SMG in the game, making it a good choice for someone who wants to combine accuracy and increased mobility. It can hold most minor scopes, and shares extended mags with some assault rifles.

                    Its only downside is its ammo capacity. As it has a very small magazine, you will probably not kill any more than 1-2 players before having to reload. Fortunately, the quick reload speed allows for increased survivability in firefights.The Extended Magazine for this weapon nearly doubles its ammo count and allows increased survivability in fights. It can fit most close range scopes as well, holding scopes from Mira Dot to the 4X scope.</p>

                <p class="para">The PP-19 Bizon is a submachine gun type weapon in BATTLEGROUNDS.Right at home in its Eastern European origins, this weapon is exclusive to Erangel and Vikendi. While in full-auto, its best suited for quick and accurate sparring in close-range. Because of the unique helical magazine that runs along the barrel, this SMG doesn't support magazine upgrades or lower rail attachments. However, the weapon has high firing stability built-in, which allows for low recoil even without a grip. With only a muzzle and sight attachment to add, you'll have a fully kitted and reliable short-range weapon in your hands faster than ever before. The Bizon is quiet but deadly 9mm submachine gun, the Bizon is best suited for quick but accurate sparring in close-range, but keep in mind that it comes with a bit of a kick. Though its overall damage per sound is lower than the UMP9 and Vector its large magazine and reduced sound will have you covered in situations that call for a quick sneak attack in close quarters </p>

                    Nicknamed "The Chicago Typewriter," The Thompson submachine gun is an American submachine gun, invented by John T. Thompson in 1918, that became infamous during the prohibition era. It was a common sight in the media of the time, being used by both law enforcement officers and criminals. Once in extensive use among US troops during WWII, as well as British forces supplied by the US Army,[1] this weapon now sees use for mowing down other players unfortunate enough to be caught in its line of fire.</p>

                <p class="para">The MP5K is a submachine gun type weapon exclusive to Vikendi, replacing the Vector on that map in BATTLEGROUNDS.The MP5K is a sub-machine gun chambered for 9mm ammunition. While the firing mechanics of the MP5K are similar to those of the Vector, it boasts a higher per bullet damage, but with a lower overall firing rate and DPS.
                    MP5K has a fire rate of 0.0645 and hit damage of 33. It uses 9mm ammo in-game and has three modes of firing: Single, Auto, and Burst. MP5K is very versatile and can be picked over Uzi any day. However, there are certain weak points of this weapon as well. It does not excel in long-range engages.

                <p class="para">The P90 Sub Machine Gun has a very high rate of fire. It uses 9mm rounds with a default magazine capacity of up to 50 shots. The high rate of fire coupled with its big magazine helps players cope up in extended fights. The aforementioned qualities make P90 one of the best SMGs in the game.

                    The gun offers all three firing modes that are available in the game. This is a great feature to have on an SMG as it can help players adapt to different situations. One can use the single fire mode in long distance combats for accurate shots.
                    
                    The burst fire mode is useful in short to medium range due to its reduced recoil rate. And, the full-auto fire mode can be used in close combats as it deal tons of damage in a short duration.
                    
                    The P90 can accept all SMG Muzzle attachments, scopes ranging from red dot to 6x and Laser Sight. The additional attachments enable the gun to be a good choice for long distance fights. It is versatile enough to be effective for short and mid-range fights too due to its firing speed.</p>
