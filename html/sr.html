                <p class="para"> The Karabiner 98 Kurz (Kar98k) is a classic bolt-action rifle weapon in BATTLEGROUNDS.

                    The Karabiner 98 Kurz is the shortened derivative of the Mauser 98 chambered in 7.92x57mm Mauser. Adopted by the German Wehrmacht in 1935, it is considered to be the pinnacle of bolt action design of that era. The Mauser action has been nearly universally copied in every bolt action rifle since its introduction.</p>

                    The M24 Sniper Weapon System (SWS) is the military and police version of the Remington Model 700 rifle, M24 being the model name assigned by the United States Army after adoption as their standard sniper rifle in 1988. The M24 is referred to as a "weapon system" because it consists of not only a rifle, but also a detachable telescopic sight and other accessories</p>

                <p class="para">The AWM, or Arctic Warfare Magnum is a bolt-action sniper rifle developed in the United Kingdom in 1996. It is chambered in the .338 Lapua Magnum caliber.

                    The Arctic Warfare platform was developed in 1983 designed for sniping in extreme climates. The rifle is iconic for its many appearances in games, and its legendary range. The AWM itself was created and entered service in 1996. The AWM variant offered a higher magnum caliber, hence its name. It was adopted as the main sniper rifle for the United Kingdom and Sweden.
                    The AWM its one of the best weapons in the game. It is one of the most accurate sniper rifles, and it's recoil and bullet recovery is only found in some of the best in the game.

                <p class="para"> The Winchester 94 or Win94 is a single shot lever action rifle used in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.

                    Performance
                    The Winchester 94 is a common lever action rifle that uses .45 ACP and has an eight round storage. It is actually a surprisingly good weapon, with good accuracy for a single shot rifle and powerful .45 rounds.
                    
                    The only downsides are itâ€™s recoil and inability to hold a scope. Using one at the later stages is not advisable.The Winchester Model 1894 is a starting medium to long range rifle that uses .45 ACP rounds. It is a guaranteed knock down in case of a head shot, when the victim does not have a level 2 helmet or higher. The only attachments available for the rifle are sniper rifle bullet loops(allowing for quicker reload speed), making it only useful for very early game.</p>

                <p class="para">The SKS is a DMR that excels in medium range combat. Its high fire-rate and damage are a deadly combination. The drawback to this rifle is that while it takes 5 attachments, it can be difficult to source them all. It also has a small magazine size without an upgrade.

                <p class="para">The VSS is a suppressed sniper rifle with permanent 4X scope & chambered for 9mm ammo. This weapon is a very rare loot spawn.
                    The VSS uses a pre suppressed barrel and scope, meaning it is great for sniping at any range and allows the perfect stealth opportunity. Its Subsonic 9mm rounds can kill most unhelmeted players with a single shot and body shots from about 2-3 rounds.

                <p class="para">The Mini 14 is a Carbine/DMR type weapon in BATTLEGROUNDS.

                    A lightweight semi-automatic rifle, the Ruger Mini-14 is named so due to its resemblance as a smaller version of the M14 battle rifle. Popular with law enforcement, security personnel, hunters, ranchers and target shooters, it now sees use in picking off opponents at a distance in BATTLEGROUNDS. It has a rather lengthy reload time so make sure the area is secure before inserting a fresh magazine.

                    The Mini-14 will deal maximum damage out to 90 meters. Damage will continually decrease beyond that point, reaching its minimum value past 420 meters.</p>

                <p class="para">The Mk14 EBR (Mark 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle) is a DMR type weapon in BATTLEGROUNDS and can only be found in air drops. Originally built for US special operations units, this rifle has seen widespread use within the US military, owing to its full-power 7.62x51mm cartridge and proven reliability. In BATTLEGROUNDS, it sees use as a hard hitting long range rifle for putting down targets for anyone lucky enough to come across this weapon in an air drop.The Mk14 can be seen as a bigger version of the SKS - dealing more damage per shot and with more recoil as well. The most notable difference from the SKS is the ability of the Mk14 to switch to an automatic fire mode, enabling its wielder to deliver a huge amount of damage for different situations, whether it be house-clearing or surprise contact with another player.</p>

                <p class="para">The SLR (Self Loading Rifle), is a DMR type weapon in BATTLEGROUNDS. A semi-automatic, British version of the venerable FN FAL battle rifle, its 7.62mm cartridge it is chambered for delivers great stopping power at long distances in a moderately stable and accurate package, and has seen usage amongst various military forces across the globe for more than 50 years.The SLR can be seen as a more powerful version of the SKS, dealing more damage at the expense of more recoil. Unlike the SKS however, it lacks an attachment point for any foregrips, requiring the user to have good recoil control and steady hands. Given that its initial bullet velocity is higher than that of the SKS as well as the fact that it also reloads slower, the SLR is more suited to ranged combat where there is ample cover and time to engage enemies. The length of the weapon may become an issue in close range engagements or when attempting to peek in and out of cover constantly.</p>
