                <p class="para">A cast-iron pan purposely built for cooking up hate for your enemies.

                    In the game, the pan is capable of killing an unarmored opponent in two hits on the body or one hit to the head. The pan will also block bullets fired at players while equipped and while unequipped, allowing it to act as a small shield. It blocks shots from all ranged weapons in the game, including shotguns and the AWM. For these reasons, it is regarded as the best melee weapon in the game.</p>

                <p class="para">The crossbow is a short to medium ranged weapon. It does very high damage, with a shot to the torso capable of killing an unarmored enemy in one shot and headshots being instant kills, even through Spetsnaz helmets. It is also completely silent, allowing for stealthy kills.

                    It suffers from heavy drop, thus, medium to long range shots need to be aimed relatively high to hit a player, however it does come with a reflex sight with a unique reticle that can be used as a rangefinder, with markings for 50, 100, and 200 meter targets. Its reload time is also painfully slow and while the quiver can reduce this time, it necessitates the need for an opportunistic play style when using this weapon. Being completely silent however, this can be a viable weapon when there are only a few players left, especially in foggy weather.</p>
