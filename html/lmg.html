    <p class="para"> With 100 rounds of 5.56mm ammo per magazine, the M249 excels at room clearing, dealing slightly more damage than the 5.56mm assault rifles with a rate of fire as fast as that of the M16A4. The recoil is somewhat low, however the high rate of fire makes it harder to control.

        The bipod can be enabled by going prone, greatly reducing recoil compared to firing from a standing or crouched position, allowing more precise shots against distant targets when telescopic sights are used.
        
        All these advantages come with downsides however - as a belt-fed weapon that loads from cumbersome box magazines, it has the longest reload time of any weapon in the game, with a tactical reload just passing the 7 second mark, thus great care must be taken before choosing to reload, either ensuring that the area is fully secure before reloading or staying alert for anyone attempting to move in, or carrying a suitable backup weapon. This gun also burns through ammo very fast, particularly when keeping targets pinned behind cover, therefore it is advisable to stock up on as much 5.56mm ammo as can be carried if planning to use this weapon for extended engagements.
        
        The M249 will deal maximum damage out to 75 meters, beyond that distance damage will begin to decrease, reaching its minimum value at 385 meters. 
    <br> <br> Trivia:
    The M249 is modeled after the real weapon of the same name. As of Update 39, the M249 now comes with cloth pouches as standard, holding 75 rounds, extended mags doubling the capacity to to 150 rounds. While in reality the cloth pouches and plastic boxes hold 100 and 200 rounds respectively, the capacity was most likely lowered for gameplay purposes. Attaching the tactical stock turns it into the Para variant.
    The description for this gun holds true, at least within the game - despite weighing approximately 10 kg (22 lb) loaded with a full magazine in reality, players in the game have no issues performing actions that would normally prove difficult while carrying such a weapon, with the only real drawback being reduced movement speed when unholstered.</p>

<h2 class="title">dp28</h2> <br>
<a href="../images/guns/dp281.png" data-lightbox="gallery"> <img src="../images/guns/dp28.jpg"   style="width:700px" height="400px"></a>

<p class="para"> The DP-28 is a light machine gun type weapon in BATTLEGROUNDS. Manufactured in Russia, its Russian name is 'Пулемёт Дегтярёвa Пехотный Pulemyot Degtyaryova Pekhotny,' translating to 'Degtyaryov's infantry machine gun.' <br> <br>A slow but hard hitting machine gun, its distinctive 47-round pan magazine strikes a balance between the firepower of a full-power cartridge with the support capability of a machine gun. Its slow cyclic rate of fire means that its relatively strong recoil is somewhat manageable. Being a vintage weapon, it lacks attachments, being only capable of accepting sights up to the 6x scope, allowing greatly increased range for supporting fire.

    The bipod can be enabled by going prone, greatly reducing recoil compared to firing from a standing or crouched position, allowing more precise shots against distant targets.
    
    The DP-28 will deal maximum damage out to 50 meters, with damage falling off out to 298 meters, at which point bullets will do minimum damage.</p>
