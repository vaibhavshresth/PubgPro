     <img src="../images/guns/granade1.png"   style="width:500px" height="400px"></a>

    <p class="para">A Frag Grenade, colloquial for Fragmentation Grenade, is any grenade designed to use an explosive charge to fragment the outer shell of the grenade in a shaped or radial pattern. This fragmentation results in shrapnel, which spreads out in a pattern, causing severe damage to enemies within range, often killing them through massive internal damage or through pressure and shock when the grenade explodes in a closed space

        While pressing and instantly releasing is the most secure way to throw a frag grenade in PUBG, holding it for about 3 seconds after pulling the pin will make reacting to the grenade much harder for your enemies.
        
        Grenade will explode 5 seconds after ready delay.</p>

<h2 class="title">smoke grenade</h2> <br>
<img src="../images/guns/smoke.png"   style="width:400px" height="400px"></a>

<p class="para">Smoke grenades are a throwable device packed with a mixture of potassium chlorate, lactose, and typically a dye for signalling. The chemicals mix with air to create a smoke screen that temporarily removes battlefield awareness.
    <br> 
    A smoke grenade is a canister-type grenade used as a signaling device, target or landing zone marking device, or as a screening device for unit movements.

    Smoke grenades generally emit a far larger amount of smoke than smoke bombs, which are a type of fireworks typically started with an external fuse rather than a pin and are more complex. Smoke grenades often cost around US$40 compared to smoke bombs, which can often cost just a few cents. The phrase "to smoke", meaning to fake, bluff, or beat around the bush, comes from the military usage of smoke grenades to obscure and conceal movement. </p>

    <h2 class="title">stun grenade</h2> <br>
     <img src="../images/guns/stun.png"   style="width:500px" height="400px"></a>

    <p class="para">A Stun Grenade, also known as a flash grenade or flashbang, is a grenade with several chemical and metallurgic properties that result in a loud pop and blinding flash of light when detonated. This grenade is meant to cause temporary, not permanent damage, and is great for non-mortal wounding, though it is often used as a precursor to armed conflict to clear rooms and buildings.

        The Stun Grenade will cause strong disorientation to everyone within the blast radius (~5m) in the form of a loud ringing and a strong reduction in framerate. If detonated within a player's cone of vision (based off the FPS camera), the player will be completely blinded by white light for several seconds. (Exact timing stat needed)
        
        “	M84 Stun Grenade. (Make victims blind, deaf for max 10 sec.)	”</p>

<h2 class="title">molotov cocktail</h2> <br>
<img src="../images/guns/molo.jpg"   style="width:400px" height="400px"></a>

<p class="para"> Molotov Cocktails create an area of fire on the ground around where they impact. Players hit by or passing through this area will be set aflame, doing constant damage over time. Molotov Cocktails can be used offensively, but don't bounce like other throwable weapons. Another potential use of a molotov cocktail is area denial. If you set the staircase on fire, players will not be able to pursue you up to higher floors, and you can use this extra time to set up a kill zone or escape off a balcony. Molotov cocktails can also be used defensively to obscure an enemy's line of sight.
    <br>
    Molotov cocktail, also known as a petrol bomb, gasoline bomb, bottle bomb, poor man's grenade, fire bomb (not to be confused with an actual fire bomb), fire bottle or just Molotov, sometimes shortened as Molly, is a generic name used for a variety of bottle-based improvised incendiary weapons.

    Due to the relative ease of production, Molotov cocktails have been used by criminals, protesters, rioters, urban guerrillas, terrorists, irregular soldiers, or even regular soldiers short on equivalent military-issue weapons. They are primarily intended to ignite rather than completely destroy targets, and are often used just as much to cause chaos as to actually do damage, sometimes being used as weapons during riots and mass protest.
