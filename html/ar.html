Modernized Kalashnikov Automatic Rifle) is an improved version of the original AK-47, featuring improvements and refinements in manufacturing and materials to create a modernized version of one of the most recognizable firearms in the world.
                    A powerful assault rifle that uses 7.62mm ammunition, this rifle does more damage than the 5.56mm assault rifles and comes with a kick to match. It is best used in single-shot mode except when attempting to breach buildings with it.

A tactical rifle based on the discontinued XM8-project as an improvement of both the M16/AR-15 and the M4 Carbine, it integrates the short-stroke gas piston system from the G36 rifle for less recoil and increased reliability. Adopted by the militaries of several countries across the world, in BATTLEGROUNDS it proves very popular due to the number of attachments it can accept, allowing a great amount of flexibility</p>

                <p class="para">The M16A4 is an assault rifle type weapon in BATTLEGROUNDS. Replacing the US military's M14 as its standard service rifle, the first M16s were introduced in 1964 during the Vietnam War where they quickly grew an infamous reputation for reliablity problems, amongst other issues. Feedback from battlefield experience was then used to refine and improve the gun over the years and as a result, many derivatives and variants of the M16 have been created, with the fourth generation M16A4 being the latest development. Widely adopted by militaries around the world, in BATTLEGROUNDS it proves to be an assault rifle more suited for longer range engagements.</p>

                <p class="para"> The Beryl M762 is an Assault Rifle in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds that uses 7.62mm.

                    The M762 can be described as a slightly inferior, non-air-drop-exclusive version of the Groza, with overall performance slotted between the Groza and AKM. The base damage of this gun is slightly lower than that of the other 7.62mm assault rifles, which is compensated by its fairly high rate of fire for a non-air-drop weapon. The vertical recoil of this compared to the AKM is slightly higher. A barrel, magazine, sight and grip can be attached to this weapon. Due to its high recoil and restrictive iron sights, equipping a grip (preferbly, the Vertical Grip) and a sight attachment is vital. Much like the AKM and Groza, using this gun for long-range engagements is not recommended.</p>

With higher base damage and muzzle velocity than the AKM, Beryl M762, or Groza, the Mutant does the most damage per shot of any assault rifle, and is easier to use at long range than its other 7.62mm brethren. However, it also has the smallest magazine size of any assault rifle and lacks a full-auto mode, which makes it more difficult to use in close-quarters engagements.</p>

                    Right at home in its central European origins, the G36C's damage per second is lower than its popular 5.56mm brother, the M416. But it makes up for what it lacks in DPS, with better control especially when engaging your enemies at short to medium range
