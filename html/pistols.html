                <p class="para"> The P92 is the most effective pistol in the game, with the best rate of fire, magazine capacity, and lowest recoil. It carries 9mm rounds, which are effective against unarmoured targets.

                    However, Itâ€™s Victory is close to the P1911, die to the P1911 surpassing the P92 in damage and range.</p>

It is chambered in the 45 ACP or Automatic Colt Pistol caliber, and revolutionized the modern handgun. It was deployed in the first World War successfully, and soon gained reputation throughout the world as a reliable pistol. The M1911, and its M1911A1 variant also served in World War 2, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. It also sees limited use to this day.</p>

                <p class="para">The R1895 is a pistol type weapon in BATTLEGROUNDS.

                    The Nagant M1895 (simply called the R1895 in-game) is a seven-shot revolver originally issued to members and combatants of the Russian Empire. It was originally chambered for the proprietary 7.62x38mmR round, but because of its dimensions, it can also fire .32S&W, .32S&W Long, and .32H&R Magnum cartridges. It solves the issue of reduced muzzle velocities found on conventional revolvers caused by escaping gas, with a unique gas-seal system, making it one of the few revolvers in the world that can be reliably suppressed with the usage of the proprietary ammunition.</p>

                <p class="para"> A sturdy, innovative 6-shooter from Italy, firing powerful .45 caliber cartridges. Like the R1895 it replaces, it is much more powerful per shot than any other handgun but has a low ammunition capacity (which cannot be altered by means of a magazine extension) and a lower rate of fire.

                    It also differs from the R1895 in several ways:
                    
                    It fires the plentiful .45 ACP instead of 7.62 mm.
                    It carries only six rounds (instead of 7), but since its cylinder folds out, allowing all six rounds to be loaded at once (instead of rounds being loaded individually) the Rhino has a much quicker reload.
                    It cannot have a suppressor but can take a red dot sight, allowing for much easier aiming.
                    It is an unconventional revolver design that fires from the lowermost chamber instead of the uppermost, which lowers the axis of the bore and gives it significantly lower recoil than other revolvers.</p>

                <p class="para"> The Flare gun is an extremely rare weapon that when fired, calls in a custom air drop that drops a larger amount of highly valuable equipment compared to the ordinary air drop. Once a flare is fired straight up into the air and reaches an altitude of 200 meters, a plane will soon fly over the map and drop off either a crate if the player is inside the safe zone, or a BRDM-2 if outside. Firing a flare at a player causes no damage</p>

                <p class="para">The P18C is a automatic secondary and because of this it's the lowest damaging pistol in the game. Despite this, it actually boasts the highest damage per second of all the pistols, even rivaling submachine guns in terms of utility.

                    The P18C is the best secondary in the game in terms of putting down lead downrange in a hurry and can even sometimes be used as a primary if you wish to do so. The high rate of fire means a good amount of damage per second but with a rather high recoil, so users might use the P18C with attachments such as sights and barrel attachments.
