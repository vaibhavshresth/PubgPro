    <p class="para"> A 5-speed sedan, it has a higher top speed than the UAZ but at a cost of subpar off-road performance that becomes an issue over bumpy terrain. Care must be taken when driving at high speeds as it is liable to rollovers during hard cornering. The engine also does not have enough power to pull the vehicle up steep hills when stationary, so it is advisable that speed is maintained when driving up hills.

        As with other vehicles, gas cans can be used while stationary to refuel, and a horn can be used to get the attention of teammates or anyone else within earshot of the horn. Cruising speed on a level surface tops out at around 105 km/h, however the engine can be boosted for a maximum speed of 131 km/h at the cost of increased fuel consumption. Like most other vehicles, the tires are vulnerable to gunfire and if destroyed, will reduce speed and handling performance. </p>
