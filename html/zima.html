        Serving as Vikendi's counterpart to the UAZ, it features decent speed, 4 wheel drive and seats for 4. Like the UAZ, the Zima handles Vikendi's arctic environment quite well, being a very stable, if somewhat slower vehicle. Driving over snow sees a reduction in handling performance but it is still more manoeuvrable than most other vehicles available to players.

        As with other vehicles, gas cans can be used while stationary to refuel, and a horn can be used to get the attention of teammates or anyone else within earshot of the horn. Cruising speed on a level surface tops out at around 100 km/h, however the engine can be pushed to deliver a maximum speed of ~115 km/h at the cost of increased fuel consumption. Like most other vehicles, the tires are vulnerable to gunfire and if destroyed, will reduce speed and handling performance.
