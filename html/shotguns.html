                <p class="para">The S686 offers unparalleled burst damage in CQB due to its ability to almost instantaneously fire two 12-gauge shells, but it quickly loses damage at range unless equipped with a choke, and has a very long reload time, making dealing with enemies at range or more than one enemy difficult. Although it is tied with the sawed-off shotgun in that both have the lowest ammo capacity of the shotguns in the game, the S686 has the fastest rate of fire of all the shotguns, allowing for skilled users to potentially gain an upper hand in otherwise unfortunate situations.</p>

                <p class="para"> The S1897, or Winchester Model 1897 is a pump action shotgun developed by John Browning and started production in 1897. It holds 5 12 gauge shells. During the Philippine-American War and the first World War, the shotgun was issued to American soldiers. It proved to be effective at clearing out trenches, so much so that Germany protested it's use in the war.One of the best shotguns in the game, this classic pump action shotgun gets the dirty work done. With up to 5 rounds stored in the gun, it can kill unhelmeted players with one-shot (With headshots), and ammo is common.</p>

                <p class="para"> The Saiga-12K (referred to as the S12K in-game) is a shotgun in BATTLEGROUNDS. A semi-automatic, magazine fed 12-gauge shotgun, it is able to lay down an obscene amount of damage over a wide area since it doesn't need to be manually cycled between shots.
                    What the S12K lacks in range, it makes up in sheer volume. The S12K is a devastating weapon at close range while its semi-automatic action makes killing multiple enemies easier than with its pump-action or double-barrel counterparts. The weapon also has an advantage over other shotguns in its reloading time due to being magazine-fed. While its rate of fire allows four shells to be discharged within one second, the extreme recoil means putting multiple consecutive shots into the intended target difficult.</p>

                <p class="para">The DP-12 (referred to as the DBS in-game) is a double barrel pump-action bullpup shotgun that can only be obtained from Care Packages in BATTLEGROUNDS.A bullpup style shotgun that can hold up to 14 shells of 12 Gauge lethality, it has by far the largest damage potential of any shotgun available in the game, countered by the fact that reloading that many shells will take an obscene amount of time. The DBS has a unique method of firing in that the pump is racked after every two shells fired, chambering the next two, making it excellent for dealing burst damage by peeking in and out of cover with each shot. Being a shotgun, the DBS is best used in close quarters combat situations when you want to end a fight quickly and efficiently</p>
