                The Minibus is a six-seat vehicle, allowing transport for a full squad. With two spare seats, this can also be used to ambush enemy squads. It has the highest health of any vehicle in the game, but this is countered by the fact that it has exceedingly poor acceleration and sluggish handling, as well as poor off-roading capability due to the weak engine which can often struggle to accelerate on a relatively shallow slope, even when flooring the pedal.

                The increased number of seats can be used however for four man squads. Alternating players in a zig-zag fashion down the vehicle allows for an even amount of firepower along the length of the vehicle, while a player sitting beside the driver can cover the front and right, with the other two players sitting in the back to fend off enemies chasing them down, as well as covering some of the side flanks. A benefit of the increased health of the vehicle is that it can be used for cover much longer than other vehicles before being blown up.

                As with other vehicles, gas cans can be used while stationary to refuel, and a horn can be used to get the attention of teammates or anyone else within earshot of the horn. Cruising speed on a level surface tops out at around 80 km/h, however the engine can be boosted for a maximum speed of 105 km/h, although it will take a very long time to reach this speed unless driving down a slope.
